# Melanoma Classification using a Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks ðŸª€

This repository contains the code to train, compare and evaluate two types of models:
- Segmentation models: yield masks that denote the birthmarks on human skin
- Classification models: yield labels whether the input image contains simple birthmark or a melanoma cancer mark
